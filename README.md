# Strong Lensing Simulations 

This simulation toolbox is based on Lenstronomy [Birrer & Amara 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PDU....22..189B/abstract) python package and produce simulations built on real data.  

The sources are gri-HSC ultra-deep stacks images combined with HST F814W high resolution images, more details about how they were obtained see [Canameras et al. (2020)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2020/12/aa38219-20.pdf)

The lenses in this example are LRGs from the Dark Energy Survey. 

These simulations were created to be used in **Rojas et al. in prep.**
